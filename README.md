# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Hello!

In my website I have completed each of the following requirments to the best of my ability. I have created my file in such a way that each html file has a corresponding style sheet that it will use.

1. index.html file:
  - contains 4 buttons that will take you to each of the 4 different html files I have coded.

  - Originally I had used my own button that I had designed, but since we were asked to use Boostrap 4 components I chose the button that would well suite my project.

  - I also added the Project0 requirments to the homescreen in an unordered list as well.

  - In this file I have used -classes and an -id.

1a. Stylesheet index.css:
  - In this file you can fine the way I have styled my home page. I have used an image as my background.

2. Hobbies.html file:
  - I have used a bootstrap method .container to display some f my hobbies and talents.

  - I have also added pictures for each of the hobbies/talents.

2a. Hobbies.css:
  - In this file you can fine the way I have styled my hobbies page.

  - I have made it in a what smaller screens view the content slightly differently.

3. ConferenceServices.html file:
  - I tried to put the most important elements the make up the conference services department at St. John's. I used the bootstrap 4 to layout and display the information on the page.

  - I used columns, a container, an unordered list, and a table along with a few images to display the information.

  - I also added an additional link that will take you to were the listing of capacities are entered per building for each style.

3a. conferenceServices.html:
  - In this files you can see how I have styled my conferenceServices.html page.

  - I have put multiple parts together under one section using ',' and I have used '>' for another section to be styled in that specific way.

4. capacities.html:
  - In this page I have used an unordered list to display all the building we offer layouts.

  - All the building names are hyperlinked so that if one wanted to go to a specific building they do not have to keep scrolling, they can just click on the name.

  - To display each building's information I have used a table for specific room, style, and umber of people that are allowed.

4a. capacities.css file:
  - I have styled the headers, and tables here.

5. SATA.html:
  - In this file I gave information about the club I was involoved in. I added the logo at the top of the page.

  - All the topics are in an unordered list and are hyperlinked so that if one wanted to go to a specific one they do not have to keep scrolling, they can just click it.

  - I put the goals of each of the clubs that make up SATA in a table along with photos.

  - I created a container with columns for the events that we host and added the flyers as well.

5a. SATA.css:
  - This file shows how I styled the  headers, image, table and content for the SATA.html file.
