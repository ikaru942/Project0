              <p>I went to an all girls high school and was a part of many different clubs as well as sports teams. I continued to play basketball from middle school to high school. I joined the 'All By Hand Club' the 'Art Club' and the 'HTMLadies Club' where we learnt about various different programming languages. I found it fascinating how we use everyday programs for granted without really understanding the underlying concepts of how each program and software is made. That is what lead me to ultimately pursue Computer Science as my major when I went to college. All these different clubs played a role in my life. I found new hobbies that I enjoyed doing as well as an interest in a future career path.</p>
              <p>From the start of my college career, I have been involoved in a club that initially was only referred to as the Computer Science Club and I also started working with Conference Services within the University. I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and now am pursuing my masterâ€™s in Business Administration. I picked Business Analytics as my concentration because I was intrigued with a graduate course, I had taken my senior year of undergrad. I enjoy doing many of my classes that I have taken until now. I unfortunately along with everyone else had to carry on learning in the safety of our home due to COVID-19. I have just finished taking my finals last week and now am taking the Harvard CS50 class to refresh my coding skills. I have taken a similar class like this about a year and a half ago and haven't been able to do much coding recently, so this is a great class to refresh my memory as well as learn new strategies that I have not gotten a chance to implement and use.</p>
